THINK: Okay, the user is having trouble installing rdkit-pypi using pip. Let me recall my knowledge about RDKit installations.

Hmm, RDKit is a cheminformatics library, and I remember that it's not directly available via PyPI under the name 'rdkit-pypi'. The correct package name on PyPI is just 'rdkit', but even that might not work for some systems because RDKit is often distributed through conda for easier installation, especially on macOS and Windows. 

The user is using macOS, as seen from the terminal output. They tried 'pip install rdkit-pypi', which failed because that package doesn't exist. So the error message makes sense. I need to guide them to install RDKit correctly.
